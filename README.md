# -AC-Voltage-Tester-Circuit

## Description
This project showcases the development of an AC Voltage Tester Circuit, designed to detect AC wires through walls. The circuit employs components such as CD4017, BC547 NPN Transistor, capacitors, LEDs, and a LiPo battery to create a versatile and practical testing tool for electrical applications.

## Features
- **Wireless AC Detection:** The circuit is capable of detecting AC wires wirelessly, even when they are concealed behind walls or surfaces.
- **Compact and Portable:** Designed with portability in mind, the compact form factor and integration of a LiPo battery make it easy to carry and use in various settings.
- **LED Indicators:** Utilizes LEDs to provide visual feedback, indicating the presence of AC voltage, making it user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Easy-to-Use:** Simple operation ensures accessibility for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Video Demonstration
A video demonstrating the functionality and usage of the AC Voltage Tester Circuit is available [here](https://github.com/santron1/-AC-Voltage-Tester-Circuit/assets/167627757/1c5359b7-97b6-4b1a-b110-cdbead492f5a).

## Usage
1. Power on the circuit by activating the LiPo battery.
2. Hold the circuit near the area where AC wires are suspected to be present.
3. Observe the LED indicators:
   - If an AC voltage is detected, the LED will illuminate, indicating the presence of live wires.
   - If no AC voltage is detected, the LED will remain off.

## Future Enhancements
Future iterations of the AC Voltage Tester Circuit may include additional features such as:
- Improved sensitivity and accuracy in detecting AC voltage.
- Integration with smartphone apps for remote monitoring and control.
- Enhanced safety features for user protection.
